# SVG-logo-maker

## Description
  
In order to quickly create a logo for a product, company, or brand, I have created a program that will quickly draw up a simple design via user input. Since svg are scalable with resolution, it was decided that they would best be used for creating images using this file format. Building this project taught me numerous things about dependicies, the importance of utilizing open source software, how to create svg files and their purpose, and testing my applications with jest.
